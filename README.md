# Text-Compression
  * With the widespread use of digital communication systems, there is a need for efficient and reliable data transmission techniques. Data compression is a method that tries to lessen the size of data by eliminating redundancy in order to conserve storage space and increase the efficiency of transmission. 
  * Data compression is the process of decreasing the size of digital data, such as images, audio, and text files, without any significant loss of information. The main objective of data compression is to reduce the storage space required to store data and to transmit it more efficiently over various communication networks. There are two main types of data compression namely, lossless and lossy compression
* Lossless compression algorithms compress data without losing any information. The original data can be reconstructed exactly from the compressed data. Examples of lossless compression algorithms include Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression and Huffman coding. 
 * Lossy compression algorithms, on the other hand, discard some information to achieve higher compression ratios. The reconstructed data may not be exactly the same as the original data. Examples of lossy compression algorithms include JPEG for images and MP3 for audio.
 * LZW compression is a lossless compression algorithm that was developed in the 1980s. It is commonly used for compressing text files, such as those used in email, word processing, and other applications. LZW works by replacing repeated sequences of characters with a code that represents that sequence. As the algorithm encounters more repeated sequences, it builds a dictionary of codes that can be used to represent those sequences, resulting in further compression.
 * Huffman coding is another lossless compression algorithm that works by assigning variable-length codes to characters based on their frequency of occurrence. Characters that occur more frequently are assigned shorter codes, while less frequently occurring characters are assigned longer codes. The compressed data is then made up of these variable-length codes. Huffman coding is commonly used in file compression utilities and is the basis for the compression used in the ZIP file format.
 * This research paper aims to explore two commonly used lossless compression algorithms: Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression and Huffman coding. The performance of these algorithms have also been evaluated by comparing their compression ratios, encoding and decoding speeds, and memory requirements.
